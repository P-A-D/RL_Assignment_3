The repository for assignment #3 of the Reinforcement Learning course - Spring 2024

Student names: Pedram Abdolahi Darestani - Zahra Jabari

Part1.py and Runs1.ipynb files in the repository are for Part 1 of the assignment and Part2.py Runs2.ipynb are for Part 2. If you would like to run the code to replication of the results, you can open the Runs1 and Runs2 notebooks and follow the same convention shown in each section of the respective question. The notebooks make calls to the python files in order to carry out the required algorithms. The class names are chosen appropriately to reflect what they do and what algorithm they run. As a result, the notebooks are quite self-explanatory and can be followed without much effort in understanding the code.

In case there are any questions or ambiguity, please reach out to pabdolahidar@mun.ca for further explanation.
